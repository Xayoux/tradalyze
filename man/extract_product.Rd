\usage{
extract_product(
  codes_vector,
  path_output = NULL,
  revision_origin = c("HS0", "HS1", "HS2", "HS3", "HS4", "HS5", "HS6"),
  revision_destination = c("none", "HS0", "HS1", "HS2", "HS3", "HS4", "HS5", "HS6"),
  return_output = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{codes_vector}{A vector of characters containing, 6-digit codes,
sections, or chapter of the HS classification.}

\item{path_output}{Path to save the output. If NULL (the default), output
will not be saved. Saving is possible in "csv" or "xlsx" format.}

\item{revision_origin}{A character indicating the HS revision of the
codes given in the \verb{codes_vector parameters}. By default this is the revision
"HS0" (1988/1992). The value can be : "HS1" (1996), "HS2" (2022), "HS3" (2007),
"HS4" (2012) or "HS5" (2017). If the version of the
\link{concordance} package is greater than 2.1.0 you can also
choose "HS6" (2022).}

\item{revision_destination}{Character. If "none" (the default), no
concordance is made between the given codes and codes from another revision.
If a revision number is supplied, concordance will be made.  The values for
the revision number are: "HS0" (1988/1992), "HS1" (1996), "HS2" (2022),
"HS3" (2007), "HS4" (2012) or "HS5" (2017). If the version of the
\link{concordance} package is greater than 2.1.0, you can also
select "HS6" (2022). \code{revision_destination} can't be the same as
\code{revision_origin}.}

\item{return_output}{Logical indicating whether output must be returned
or not. By default output is returned.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the 6-digits codes and their description
for the wanted original revision (\code{revision_origin}).
\describe{
\item{HS_revision_origin}{6-digit codes for the \code{revision_origin}}
\item{desc_revision_origin.}{Description of the code for the \code{revision_origin}}
}

If a \code{revision_destination} is supplied. Two others columns are made :
\describe{
\item{HS_revision_destination}{6-digit codes for the \code{revision_destination}}
\item{desc_revision_destination.}{Description of the code for the \code{revision_destination}}
}

The output can also be a csv or xlsx file.
}
\description{
Take a vector of HS codes, sections or chapters and return a
data frame with all the corresponding 6-digit HS codes and their description.
These codes can be in any revision. It is also possible to make a
correspondence between the codes of the original revision and another
revision. This is useful for the
\href{http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37}{BACI}
database because, depending on the revision of BACI chosen, the codes must
be in the good revision (1992 revision if you want the oldest data). The
concordance between revisions is done with the \link[concordance]{concord_hs}
function of the \link{concordance} package. The list of codes
is also taken from that package.
}
\details{
To use the latest revision ("HS6" for the 2022 revision) you must
have a version greater or equal to 2.1.0 of the \link{concordance}
package. This version is not available on CRAN. To download it, please
uninstall the concordance package and run the following code :
\code{devtools::install_github("insongkim/concordance", dependencies=TRUE)}.
Make sure that you also have devtools. See the
\href{https://github.com/insongkim/concordance}{github page} of the concordance
package. If you use the function without the correct version of the
concordance, you will be asked if the function can download it for you.
